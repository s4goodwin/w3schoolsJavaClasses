public class modifiers {

    //Access Modifiers
    //For classes, you can use either public or default:
    //For attributes, methods and constructors, you can use public, private, default and protected

    //Non-Access Modifiers
    //For classes, you can use either final or abstract:
    //For attributes and methods, you can use final, static, abstract, transient, synchronized and volatile

    //Static
    //A static method means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public:

    //Abstract
